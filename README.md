# WeatherApp

Tutorials:
This is the main tutorial I am following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAV2Uqv9KLo

Our main approach is to work on our tutorials individually and if we run into issues try to debug together. Commit any changes to our individual branches and when we are done make sure they run on all our devices. 

Also, keep commentary regarding to which steps of the tutorial/process you are in so that if we run into similar problems we can figure the solution out.
